## 🛠️  Features

**🚧 Available now**
- Recipe-based system: chain multiple operations in sequence
- Base64 encode & decode , HEX encode & decode , Cipher
- Save and load recipes  
- Dark-themed GUI with separate encrypt/decrypt panels  

**🚧 Planned / Work in progress**
- Auto-Detect mode ✨: analyze input and suggest operations  
- AES encryption & decryption  
- Classic ciphers  
- Hashing tab (MD5, SHA-256)

> See **Roadmap** below for details.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/sh4dowkey/CryptoSuite.git
cd CryptoSuite

# (Optional) create and activate venv
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python main.py

# This will launch the graphical user interface.
```

---


## 📖 Basic Usage

1.  Launch the application by running `python main.py`.
2.  In the **"Encrypt / Encode"** panel on the left, type your text into the "Input" box.
3.  Click the **"Add Operation"** dropdown and select **"To Base64"**.
4.  The encoded result will instantly appear in the "Output" box.
5.  You can add more operations to the recipe or save the current recipe using the **"Save Recipe"** button.
